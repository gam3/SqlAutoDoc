Description: Utility to create a SQL database schema overview in HTML, DOT and XML
 This is a utility which will run through SQL tables and returns HTML,
 DOT, and 2 styles of XML which describes the database.
 .
 The HTML is human readable (via webbrowser). The first style of XML is
 actually the fileformat of Dia, a UML diagram tool. The second type of XML is
 similar to the HTML but in the Docbook 4 format. It enables you to mix in
 other DocBook documentation via the XREFs, generating PDFs, HTML, RTF, or
 other formatted documents. Between these tools and JavaDoc with the
 appropriate XREFs, documentation about a project can be generated quickly and
 be easily updatable yet have a very professional look with some DSSSL work.
